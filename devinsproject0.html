  Devin Harris' Project 0 Submission
  <ol>
    <li>My website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on my website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
    <li>My website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
    <li>My website must have at least one stylesheet file.
    <li>My stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. I must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
    <li>My stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
    <li>I must use Bootstrap 4 on the website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
    <li>My stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
    <li>In README.md, I must include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about my project.
    </li>
